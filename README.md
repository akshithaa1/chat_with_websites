Website Content Scraping, Embedding, and Text Generation
This project demonstrates how to scrape content from websites, store the content as embeddings using a pre-trained model, and generate relevant responses to queries based on the scraped data. It integrates web scraping, similarity search using FAISS, and text generation using a language model.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to fetch and scrape textual data from multiple websites, convert the data into embeddings, and store them in a FAISS index for efficient similarity search. Upon receiving a query, the system retrieves the most relevant pieces of text and generates a contextually accurate response using a language generation model (distilgpt2).

Key Features:
Web Scraping: Scrape textual content from websites (e.g., University websites).
Embedding Generation: Convert the scraped content into embeddings using SentenceTransformers.
FAISS Index: Store the embeddings in a FAISS index for fast and efficient similarity search.
Text Generation: Use a pre-trained model (distilgpt2) to generate responses based on the retrieved content.
Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the project:

requests
beautifulsoup4
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
transformers
huggingface_hub
You can install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers huggingface_hub
Setup
Scrape Website Content: The program first scrapes the content from the provided list of websites using the BeautifulSoup library. This content is then processed and stored in a dictionary for later use.

Generate Embeddings: Each scraped text chunk is converted into embeddings using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformers model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings are then stored in a FAISS index.

Query and Response Generation:

A user query is embedded using the same Sentence-Transformers model.
A similarity search is performed on the FAISS index to find the most relevant text chunks.
The relevant chunks are combined into a context and passed to the distilgpt2 model to generate a response.
How to Use
Setup Hugging Face Authentication: To use models from Hugging Face, you may need to authenticate by running the following command:

python
Copy code
from huggingface_hub import login
login()
This will prompt you to enter your Hugging Face credentials.

Scrape and Generate Responses: After setting up the environment, you can use the provided function to scrape websites and generate responses. For example:

python
Copy code
query = "What is the history of the University of Chicago?"
response = generate_response(query, index, embeddings)
print(response)
This will print a response based on the context retrieved from the FAISS index.

Example Output
Here is an example of the output for a query:

Query: "What is the history of the University of Chicago?"

Generated Response:

vbnet
Copy code
Query: What is the history of the University of Chicago?
Context:
Text not found for index 1
Text not found for index 2
Text not found for index 4
Answer: "So much of the history of the University of Chicago, including all the other students who were in the classroom, was done to the university that the professors were working on."
On January 23, 2011, the university issued a press release saying, "We are honored to host this prestigious event in Chicago. The school will be participating in the second annual celebration of the campusâ€™s history," adding, "This event is designed to bring the power of historical data to inform the public of the..."
